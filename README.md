## TODO
- [x] Figure out how to download stuff
- [x] ~~Handle download limits i.e. Can only download 6 files at a time.~~ I think Chrome handles this.
- [x] GUI
- [x] Specify download path (filesystem can only be used on Chrome apps, can have option to insert path via GUI?)
- [x] Name files downloaded
- [ ] Support incognito?
- [ ] Differentiate between recordings on the same day?
- [ ] Migrate to MDL (Material Design Lite)
- [ ] Fix download blocking (multiple downloads, slow internet)

## Known Issues
- Downloading many files in a short time span sometimes leads to Echo360 or Amazon S3 blocking downloads (sometimes it greys out lectures).
